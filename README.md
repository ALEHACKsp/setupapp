# How to use

- Jailbreak your device
- Open terminal and run the following commands
- git clone https://github.com/khevin014/setupapp.git
- cd setupapp
- chmod +x untethered.sh
- run ./untethered.sh
- setup your device as usual (note: iCloud isn't working yet, so please skip apple id setup)
- enjoy
- to download apps from the appstore, sign your account in through the app store app

## Troubleshooting

- make sure you are coming from a fresh restore/update before following the guide
- once bye passed, logging in to iCloud upon setting up your device will cause an error, skip signing in while setting up and sign in from the App Store instead
